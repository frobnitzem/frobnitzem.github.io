  So lately, I've been trying to determine if there's an
exact, mathematically optimal way to make saving and spending
decisions.  The simple answer was given in the post on
[Consumption Function Analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-27-consumption %}).  It says that you should spread out your spending evenly
and increase it regularly at the market rate.
Unfortunately, it does not take into account any
uncertainty inherent in chasing a market rate that is higher
than inflation.

  Before I start, I should note that the earlier, simple formula
can be improved significantly and applied in practice by doing the following:

1. Add up all income you will receive over the rest of your lifetime, not counting increases for inflation, and counting only after-tax income.
2. Break that total into two numbers, a smaller, 'safe bet' number, and a larger, 'optimistic' number.
3. Add up all your current yearly expenses in today's dollars and multiply by your maximum lifespan -- no correction for inflation.
4. Break that total into two numbers, a smaller, 'required' expenses number,
and a larger, 'comfortable', number.
  * Also, scale up your medical expenses and scale down your mortgage expenses to get a good estimate of a lifetime average.
5. Note that if all three (savings, income, and expenses) increase with the same rate of inflation, you can make the complete calculation in today's dollars.
6. Do a reality check.  Does your minimum income cover your minimum expenses for your life expectancy?
  * If not, it's time to balance your budget or think about delaying retirement.
  * If it's close and you're nearing retirement, you're probably uncertain about social security and medical costs (as you should be).  Think about annuities that move with inflation and health insurance options to limit that risk.
7. Assuming you fall somewhere in the middle, plan on investing enough to cover your required expenses on low risk assets.  The rest is excess income
that you can invest at high risk and divide up into annual spending as well.
Obviously, you should keep track of these numbers when life events happen and adjust your plans accordingly.

  With that, let's dive into the mathematical analysis.
First, the Bellman equation is all about answering the question,
'How much will \\\(W_{t+1}\\\) dollars be worth to me next year,
given that the world is in state \\\(S_{t+1}\\\)?'
The quantitative answer is some function, \\\(V_{t+1}(W_{t+1}, S_{t+1})\\\).
What the Bellman equation says is that the value function
at the current time is equal to the average value function
in the future:

<p>
$$
  V_t(W_t, S_t) = \max_{C_t} \int \left(
    V_{t+1}(W_{t+1}, S_{t+1}) + U(C_t)
  \right) dP(W_{t+1}, S_{t+1} | W_t, S_t, C_t)
$$
</p>

The integral is over the probability of future wealth,
and state of the economy, \\\( W_{t+1}, S_{t+1} \\\)
given that we make the decision \\\( C_t \\\).
Since the decision is up to us, we are going to pick
the one with maximum expected value.

That being said, there are two extreme cases to be aware
of.  First, say we are just scraping by, so that there is
nothing we really get to decide and \\\( C_t \\\)
is as much as we can afford.  In that case, the Bellman
equation degenerates into a way to calculate the expected
course of the economy in general.  In other words,
\\\(dP(W_{t+1}, S_{t+1} | W_t, S_t, C_t)\\\) has to
contain our model for the economic growth, \\\( S_{t+1} | S_t \\\).

The other extreme is where the economic model
is perfectly known.  The example we started with was
that everything grows predictably at the rate of inflation.
In that case, we can make decisions without worrying about
randomness at all.

In-between, we can take a stochastic process model for
the economy and make spending decisions based on it.
As individuals, our decisions are mostly decoupled from
the economy as a whole, so we don't have to worry about
our spending decisions affecting gross domestic product --
we'll leave that to Gates, Soros, and The Fed.

  What I would like to say is that there is a simple stochastic
process model for the economy as a system.
Unfortunately, there are so many unknowns
and pitfalls in trying to predict the economy that
even the experts advise us to take expert advice with *two* grains of salt.
Nevertheless, let's investigate some solutions of the Bellman
equation.  I wasn't happy with the [Levy distribution fit earlier]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-fitting %}), so I used the simplest choice,

<p>
$$
  dP(z = \log(S_{t+1}/S_t))/dz = \frac{ab}{a+b} \begin{cases}
  e^{-a(m-z)}/a & m > z, \\
  e^{-b(z-m)}/b & z \ge m
  \end{cases}
$$
</p>

![Fitting two exponentials to S&P500 yearly returns](/assets/images/sp500_2exp.png)

This says the market randomly wins or loses every year with maximum
probability at 12.8% return.
Its long negative tail makes the
average return somewhere around 8%, while the expectation of
the appreciated value, \\\( e^z \\\), is about 9%.
That's a fairly good gamble, despite the significant risk.

You might ask why the last year's returns don't enter the model.
It's hard to believe, but historically,
the past year's returns don't help predict the next year's returns
much at all -- so it's simpler to ignore them.

Finally, some code:

```
from numpy import *
from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import laggauss
import pylab as plt

######### create quadrature rules globally ###########
Nquad = 20

# 20-point Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for weight exp(-x) on [0,infty)
# note: 0 is not a quadrature point
x_log, w_log = laggauss(Nquad)

# m, a, b parameters for 2-sided exp distribution
m, a, b = [  0.1279548,   7.16394812, 11.7499037 ]

# create its quadrature array
x_2exp = hstack([ m-x_log[::-1]/a, m+x_log/b ])
w_2exp = hstack([   w_log[::-1]*b,   w_log*a ]) / (a+b)

M = 3 # dimensionality

R1 = 1.03     # risk-free rate
R2 = exp(x_2exp) # market rate (array of possibilities)
quad = lambda z: dot(z, w_2exp)

Year = 1.0
util = lambda c: -1./c
# spending x[2] this year and all market gains next year
V = lambda x: Year*quad(util(R1*x[0,:,:,newaxis] + R2*x[1,:,:,newaxis])) \
                + util(x[2])

W = 100.0
c0, c1 = 45.0, 57.0
r0, r1 = 0.01, 30.0
c = linspace(c0, c1, 100)
rf = linspace(r0, r1, 100)
x  = zeros((3, 100, 100), float)
x[2] = c[:,newaxis]    # spending
x[0] = rf[newaxis,:]   # risk-free investment
x[1] = W - x[0] - x[2] # market investment
plt.imshow(V(x).T, extent=(c0, c1, r0, r1), origin='lowerleft', aspect='auto')
plt.gca().set_xlabel("Spending")
plt.gca().set_ylabel("Bonds")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
plt.savefig('value.png')
```

![Value function](/assets/images/value.png)

The plot above shows the resulting value function for spending,
saving, and investing when you have only 2 years to live
with $100,000 in your pocket and the option to buy a 1 year
CD for 3% (saving) or invest in the market.  Units are
thousands of dollars.

Apparently, the maximum expected value is found when
spending about $51,000 and throwing the rest into
the stock market.  Personally, I might not make that choice
because of the real risk of taking a 10% loss
on the market -- leaving only $44,000 in the last year.
So we probably need to tweak the value function a bit
to distinguish required vs. excess spending.

Of course, repeating this procedure for all starting situations,
\\\(W_t, S_t\\\), backward to the present
will allow making decisions based on the incomplete information
we have now.  The final conclusion is the common cliche
that to do this properly, you really have to know your risk
tolerance (that is, what is your utility function?).
