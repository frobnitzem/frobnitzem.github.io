I have quite a few new programming projects moving lately, and wanted to
find a nice code publishing environment to write general notes
and documentation on them.

My github profile had been sorely lacking attention for
awhile, so I decided to follow their
[Right Way(TM) instructions](https://pages.github.com/)
for building a nice developer site.

My first thought was "Oh, no! Not another markup language,"
since I've built a wiki with Wikitext, put together
Sphinx documentation with reStructuredText,
and used only a bit of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  Comparisons out there show that markdown parsed
by Ruby's kramdown are [not so bad for code blogs](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/10/28/markdown-or-restructuredtext-or-dita-choosing-format-tech-docs/),
so what the hey.

Although I followed [the basic instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/08-blogging) -- which are indispensible for understanding Jekyll's layout and
basic features -- the lack of included CSS
is painful unless you use a [theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).

So, I ploughed all that under and copied a theme
from [Elena Gong](http://adagio-cantabile.github.io/index.html).

So far so good.

# Issues

My first real issue was that bundler is not correctly
configured by fink on my old Mac.  There's actually
two problems here for me.  First, an update to
libssl I did during development at some point
seems to have clobbered some of my ssl certificates,
leading to `Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed` errors.
Second, the latest fink-installed ruby and gem binaries
are named ruby2.5 and gem2.5, so rvm doesn't find them.

But, I can successfully run `jekyll build`, so all
is well enough.  
My workaround for full site testing is to send the files to github
and checking the site there.  It's bad practice to publish
before locally proofing, so sooner or later
I should really fix these packaging issues...
